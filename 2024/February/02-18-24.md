### Personal Thoughts

When OpenAI first released Chat GPT, and even with the release of ChatGPT 4 and DALL-E, I still believed that we were a long ways away from Artificial Intelligence being as capable as it is today. Having a program like Sora, although it is not available for beta or full release to the public, is truly remarkable. I've seen a few takes on Sora, mainly from content creators like Marques Brownlee, and general talks on social media. Marques brought up a great use case for it. In content creation, B roll is a huge part of video creating process. Whether it's car reviews, hiking, or other activities, some of the greatest videos in this space have great B roll. Sora would certainly help with making the process of obtaining B roll easier, which can lower production time and cost of videos. This is a bit unrealistic, but one joke I saw was people could use Sora to create fake videos of people, events, etc. OpenAI has done a grear job with safety by limiting the prompts you could input. It was still a fair concern, but I don't think it should be a real concern.
